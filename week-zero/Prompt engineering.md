# 🧠 What is Prompt Engineering?

**Prompt Engineering** is the skill of writing clear and effective instructions (prompts) for AI systems like ChatGPT so that they give the best possible answers.

In simple words:

> Prompt Engineering = AI ko sahi tareeqay se samjhana what you want.

Just like you talk to a person clearly to avoid confusion, you talk to an AI clearly through a good **prompt**.
