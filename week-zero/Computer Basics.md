# 🖥️ 1. What is a Computer?

A **computer** is an electronic machine that:
- Takes input  
- Processes data  
- Produces output  
- Stores information  

> Example:  
When you type on a keyboard (input), the computer processes it and shows it on the screen (output).

# 📥 2. Input Devices

Devices used to **enter data** into a computer.

**Common Input Devices:**
- Keyboard  
- Mouse  
- Microphone  
- Scanner  
- Camera  
- Touchscreen  

> Daily Example:  
Typing a message using a keyboard or tapping on a mobile screen.

# 📤 3. Output Devices

Devices that **display or produce results**.

**Common Output Devices:**
- Monitor  
- Printer  
- Speakers  
- Projector  

> Daily Example:  
Movie playing on screen, or document printed on paper.

# 🧩 4. Hardware vs Software

## **Hardware**
Physical parts of a computer that you can touch.

Examples:
- Keyboard  
- Mouse  
- CPU  
- RAM  
- Hard drive  

## **Software**
Programs and applications that tell hardware what to do.

Examples:
- Windows  
- Chrome  
- MS Word  
- Games  
- Mobile apps  

> Simple Example:  
Hardware = Mobile phone  
Software = YouTube app

# ⚙️ 5. Types of Software

### **1. System Software**
Controls computer hardware.  
Example: **Windows, Linux, macOS**

### **2. Application Software**
Used to perform tasks.  
Example: **Word, Excel, Chrome, VS Code**

### **3. Utility Software**
Helps maintain the computer.  
Example: **Antivirus, Disk Cleanup**

# 🧠 6. Memory vs Storage (Simple Explanation)

**Memory (RAM) = Short-term memory**  
**Storage (Hard Drive / SSD) = Long-term memory**

> Example:  
RAM = Workbench (current tasks)  
Storage = Cupboard (saved files, photos)

---

# ⚡ 7. What is RAM?

**RAM (Random Access Memory)**  
- Temporary memory  
- Stores data only while the computer is ON  
- Fast  
- Used when running apps  

**More RAM = Faster performance**

> Example:  
When Chrome + VS Code + YouTube run together → RAM is used.

---

# 📘 8. What is ROM?

**ROM (Read Only Memory)**  
- Permanent memory  
- Stores essential startup instructions  
- Cannot be modified easily  
- Used to start the computer

> Example:  
When you turn on your PC, ROM helps the system boot.

---

# 💾 9. Storage Devices

- HDD (Hard Disk Drive) → Slower, cheaper  
- SSD (Solid State Drive) → Faster, expensive  
- USB Drive  
- Memory Card  

> Example:  
Your photos, videos, projects, documents — all stored here.

---

# 🧮 10. CPU — The Brain of the Computer

**CPU (Central Processing Unit)**  
- Performs all calculations  
- Executes instructions  
- Controls the entire system

> Example:  
Opening a program → CPU processes it and runs it.

---

# 🔌 11. Motherboard

The main circuit board where all components connect:
- CPU  
- RAM  
- Storage  
- Graphics card  
- Network card  

> Without a motherboard, components cannot communicate.

---

# 🌐 12. Operating System (OS)

Software that manages:
- Hardware  
- Applications  
- Files  
- Memory  
- Security  

**Examples:**
- Windows  
- Linux  
- macOS  
- Android  
- iOS  

> OS = Manager of the whole computer.

---

# 🗄️ 13. What is a Database?

A **database** is a place where large amounts of data are stored, organized, and retrieved easily.

Examples:
- Bank records  
- University student data  
- Online shopping users  
- Login information  

> When you log in to Facebook → your data comes from a database.

---

# 🔗 14. Internet vs WWW

**Internet** = Global network of computers  
**WWW (Web)** = Websites available on the internet

> Internet = Road  
> Websites = Cars running on the road

---

# 🧠 15. Bit, Byte, KB, MB, GB

- 1 Byte = 8 Bits  
- 1 KB = 1024 Bytes  
- 1 MB = 1024 KB  
- 1 GB = 1024 MB  
- 1 TB = 1024 GB  

> Example:  
A photo = 2 MB  
A movie = 1–2 GB

---

# 🔁 16. How a Computer Works (Simple Workflow)

1. **Input:** Keyboard, mouse  
2. **Process:** CPU  
3. **Memory:** RAM  
4. **Storage:** SSD/HDD  
5. **Output:** Screen, printer  

> Example:  
You type a message → CPU processes → RAM holds temporary data → Output shown on screen.
