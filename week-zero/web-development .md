## 3. How the Web Works (Basics)

1. You enter a website URL (e.g., `google.com`) in your browser.  
2. The browser sends a request to the **web server**.  
3. Server processes the request and returns **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**.  
4. Browser displays the website.

### Real-Life Example

- Google’s servers send back the results.  
- Browser displays them instantly.

### B. **Backend Development**
Handles server-side logic: authentication, database, APIs.

**Technologies:**  
- Node.js (JavaScript)  
- Python (Django, Flask)

### C. **Full-Stack Development**
A combination of frontend and backend.

**Real-Life Example:**  
A full-stack developer builds:

- UI → Frontend  
- Database → Backend  
- APIs → Backend
